The ALFRED proposal will contribute to this goal by providing a personal and interactive assistant for elderly people. ALFRED will foster independent living and active ageing, integrating interactive services for elderly people and for care-takers. It will prevail age-related  physical  and  cognitive  impairments through  the  effective  use  of  ICT  and  the  better coordination of care processes.In order to achieve those objectives, the project will create a virtual, interactive assistant for elderly people. This assistant will be realized as a mobile device running on day-to-day Android smartphones allowing a wide impact of the project results. ALFRED will be fully voice-controlled and combine latest scientific research results from mobile development, data management, context aware services, speech recognition and personal data management, combined with activities from behavioural and social science.<br/>In one sentence:<br/>ALFRED will realize a mobile, personalized Butler for elderly people helping them to stay independent, to coordinate with caregivers and to foster the active participation in society.<br/>ALFRED will be fully voice controlled and could – from a user perspective - also be described as "Siri for supporting elderly people" but with an open and extendable app background and with a clear and precise focus on improving the life of elderly people.

We aim to use ultrahigh-pressure experimental petrology to investigate the behaviour of subducted carbonate at pressures corresponding to the deep upper mantle, the mantle transition zone and the uppermost lower mantle. Earlier experimental studies showed that some residual crystalline carbonate in oceanic crust remains stable in subducting oceanic crust without decarbonation or melting, and may be transported to very deep levels in the mantle. It may form carbonate eclogite in the upper mantle and carbonate garnetite in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle. How far carbon can survive this journey to extreme depths depends on the relationship between the pressure-temperature path followed by deeply subducting carbonated oceanic crust and its melting relations and solidus temperatures. We aim to use multi-anvil experimentation at the University of Bristol to determine melting relations in the deep upper mantle, transition zone, and uppermost lower mantle (9-21 GPa) of carbonate eclogite. We will explore the influences of pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity and key bulk compositional variables such as Na2O/CO2 on very deep subduction of carbonate and on the volumes and compositions, and fates of carbonated partial melts. Fundamental research outcomes will include understanding of (1) the role of bulk composition in determining melting temperatures of deeply subducted, carbonate-bearing oceanic crust, and hence how deep carbonate melting can occur (2) how these carbonate melts interact with surrounding ambient peridotite mantle and what sort of geochemical sources and deeply derived magmas/fluids could be so generated (kimberlites, carbonatites, CH4-fluids), and (3) the formation of sublithospheric diamonds and their mineral inclusion suites.',)]
