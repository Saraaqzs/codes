As such, it is positioned as a bridge between currently good performing electrolysis cells and their efficient and reliable integration into advanced stacks to pave the way for the production of a new generation of electrolysers.   To achieve these goals, the RelHy project is based on the coupled development of instrumented single repeat units and stacks and of associated simulation tools (from cell to stack scale). This mixed experimental and simulation approach will be used on several batches of materials - to give specifications for novel or improved materials and evaluate them, where special attention is paid to material compatibility (between electrodes, electrolyte, coating, interconnects and sealing). - to propose innovative designs able to overcome the present limiting parameters and to increase stack reliability, durability and performance.

From a conceptual point of view, industrial robot technology could provide an excellent base for machining being both flexible (due to their lay-out) and cost efficient (robots cost 2-5 times less then machine tools). However, industrial robots lack absolute positioning accuracy (1), are unable to react in real time to changing process conditions (2) and lack reliable programming and simulation tools to ensure first time right machining once production commences (3).

While materials mechanical behavior under irradiation has been subject to numerous studies, the current predictive capabilities appear limited. Observations and physical models have shown that the most important damage contributions arise from point defect localization –leading to void swelling- and creep. It was recently found that void swelling can be prevented via use of non coherent heterophase interfaces. It is very likely that other interface types may exhibit similar trends. Unfortunately, no tool is available to generally predict the effect of interface composition (monophase, heterophase) and structure (geometry, roughness) on its propensity to resist radiation damage (both via defect localization and creep). These limitations motivate the proposed study which aims at developing such tool.

The color rendering is generally unsatisfactory, however, and the cost is so far prohibitive for general market penetration.\nOur NW approach is based on combining three (blue-green-red) or four (blue-green-yellow-red) single NW LEDs into one white LED package, thereby avoiding the loss in the phosphor downconversion process. Using NW LEDs we also expect to increase the radiative efficiency due to a drastic reduction of the defect density in the active quantum well (QW) regions of the LEDs, and also improve the extraction efficiency of the emitted light. Our suggested employment of large size silicon or sapphire wafers as substrates is predicted to reduce the future fabrication cost by at least a factor 3. To increase the efficiency of white emitters it is necessary to drastically improve the LEDs emitting in the green-yellow part of the spectrum. We suggest to reach the green LED range by the ability to increase the In composition in the radial QWs of the presently grown nitride NW LEDs, and by using AlGaInP materials. The latter material system will also be explored for yellow and red NW LED emission. To realize yellow-red emission quantum dot media will also be employed, either by the SK growth mechanism on the m-plane facets of the NWs, or by separate application of InP/ZnS core-shell dots with red emission.

pred sql: SELECT objective FROM projects WHERE acronym = 'DEEPCARBON';
gt sql: SELECT objective FROM projects WHERE acronym = 'DEEPCARBON'
results of pred sql: [('The key aspect of the Earth’s deep carbon cycle is how exogene carbon is recycled into the deeper earth via subduction of altered, carbonated, mafic oceanic crust. We aim to use ultrahigh-pressure experimental petrology to investigate the behaviour of subducted carbonate at pressures corresponding to the deep upper mantle, the mantle transition zone and the uppermost lower mantle. Earlier experimental studies showed that some residual crystalline carbonate in oceanic crust remains stable in subducting oceanic crust without decarbonation or melting, and may be transported to very deep levels in the mantle. It may form carbonate eclogite in the upper mantle and carbonate garnetite in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle. How far carbon can survive this journey to extreme depths depends on the relationship between the pressure-temperature path followed by deeply subducting carbonated oceanic crust and its melting relations and solidus temperatures. We aim to use multi-anvil experimentation at the University of Bristol to determine melting relations in the deep upper mantle, transition zone, and uppermost lower mantle (9-21 GPa) of carbonate eclogite. We will explore the influences of pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity and key bulk compositional variables such as Na2O/CO2 on very deep subduction of carbonate and on the volumes and compositions, and fates of carbonated partial melts. Fundamental research outcomes will include understanding of (1) the role of bulk composition in determining melting temperatures of deeply subducted, carbonate-bearing oceanic crust, and hence how deep carbonate melting can occur (2) how these carbonate melts interact with surrounding ambient peridotite mantle and what sort of geochemical sources and deeply derived magmas/fluids could be so generated (kimberlites, carbonatites, CH4-fluids), and (3) the formation of sublithospheric diamonds and their mineral inclusion suites.',)]

I am proposing to relocate to Europe. JWST's NIRISS instrument is not represented in Europe, and this program will bring immediate and proprietary access to the data. This proposal will (1) determine the timeline of reionization, (2) identify the exact role first galaxies played in this process by studying their ionized bubbles, and (3) determine stellar properties of the earliest galaxies.

Social evolution theory increasingly understands the origin and elaboration of multicellular bodies and insect societies in a joint framework of inclusive fitness theory. This approach (A.F.G. Bourke, The Principles of Social Evolution, OUP, 2011) both emphasizes the power of cooperation to achieve higher levels of organization, and the corrupting tendencies emanating from lower-levels of selection that maintain selfish traits. Genomic imprinting is the most fundamental mechanism that maintains selfish tendencies at the genome level, potentially affecting all forms of social life. While genomic imprinting is increasingly well understood in mammals, its frequency and operation in insect societies is unknown. The present proposal aims to resolve this problem by combining Chinese genome sequencing excellence (BGI Shenzhen) with a cutting-edge research program in evolutionary biology (the Copenhagen Centre for Social Evolution) while focusing on one of the best studied social insect models, the fungus-growing ants. The ambitious work proposed is feasible because it is supported by significant additional funding from the combined host institutions.

Microbial communities in eutrophic lakes contribute to a positive feedback loop which perpetuates eutrophocation. The persistence of and capability for dissemination of specific genes related to microbial metabolism in lake environments is unknown.  Phage transduction is the primary mechanism by which gene transfer events occur in bacteria.  Phage have the possibility to mediate LGT between very distantly related bacteria and transfer virulence factors and genes for metabolic adaptation across taxonomic boundaries and over long phylogenetic ranges. In this study, we will characterise microbial and phage populations as well as phage-mediated LGT in Finnish lakes using culture-independent techniques and high-throughput sequencing to determine: 1) the native microbial and phage populations in lakes at different trophic levels, 2) the cohort of functional genes carried by phage, and 3) how broad the host range of resident phage is.  We hypothesize that phage provide a reservoir for genes allowing niche adaptation and increased fitness in response to nutrient stress and/or deprivation.

Fundamental study and modelling of turbulent flows within a filtration process will be closely combined with an experimental work conducted at TU Delft laboratories and in collaboration with industrial partners. The main contributions and novelty of the proposed research include (1) development of commercial prototype and an integrated design of advanced magnetic filter for industrial application, (2) development of computational methods and tools to predict performance of filtration system in various operational regimes subjected to intense heat-mass transfer and magnetic fields (up to 12,500 Gauss), (3) computational modelling of multi-phase flows and supporting measurements using invasive and non-invasive 2D/3D fluid mechanics techniques.

These are alternative speech forms that always rely on a spoken language and that consist of mapping voiced speech signals into very different types of sounds, such as whistling, instrumental music and animal calls. These speech transformations are respectively called ‘whistled languages’, ‘the singing/speaking mode of musical instruments’ (or ‘instrumental speech’), and ‘onomatopoetic words named after animal calls’. One of the main focuses of the project will be to analyze the interrelations between production and perception in such emulation processes based on iconicity with voiced speech (with methods of linguistic description as well as behavioral and electrophysiological experiments). Indeed, each of these phenomena transforms speech in a way that highlights some language-specific phonetic and phonological processes as well as some key perceptual processes of human speech recognition. The second principal axe of the project will be to analyze the impact of the biotope on human language because such oral practices are the result of both productive and perceptive adaptations of speech to real ecological situations (both social and biological). We will focus on the impact of the acoustic constraints imposed by typical natural biotopes on such special speech forms (such as dense forests, plain open fields and deserts). Our project will include a study on how such environmental constraints also affect shouted and normal speech, as well as a comparison with animal communication adaptation to the same constraints.

These quasiparticles are made out of electrons and holes in a particular way that makes them their own antiparticle, and they appear at certain surfaces, edges or defects of these superconductors where their existence is guaranteed due to a topological protection. They have generated great excitement in the last years because their unambiguous detection would be a smoking-gun proof of the existence of a new phase of matter, and moreover, because thanks to their non-Abelian statistics they could be used to implement fault-tolerant quantum computation. The prospects of detecting and manipulating them are now seen with increasing optimism, and indeed some very recent experiments report evidence that suggests we may already have them at our fingertips.\n\nThis theoretical project will critically assess three promising proposals of TS where experiments are already available, making new predictions that will help to discern when Majorana fermions can be reliably identified. First, chains of magnetic atoms in the surface of a regular superconductor will be considered. This simple system should realize Majorana fermions at the chain edges, but is unknown whether coupling them together in networks to perform braiding operations is possible, a question this project will tackle. Then, Cu doped Bi2Se3 as an intrinsic TS will be reexamined. In view of contradicting experimental evidence from surface probes, alternative pairing models will be explored via quasiparticle interference predictions to explain the experimental data.

These measurements will provide the essential understanding of the main background to the ttH process and will also be of significant scientific interest in their own right. The second part of the project focusses on preparing the ATLAS data for the upcoming high energy LHC run, in particular commissioning the tracking detector that is undergoing a significant upgrade. This detector is essential to the successful detection of the ttH process. The final stage of the project will use state-of-the-art techniques to select the decay products of boosted top and Higgs particles.

The dominant theory uncertainty in both comes from hadronic corrections (HC) to SM processes which are very difficult to calculate precisely. Lattice QCD has uses high performance computing to calculate these numerically and has been very successful for many hadronic physics calculations.\n\nThis proposal has two parallel themes. The first involves using lattice QCD to calculate HC in B-meson decays. This project will carry out the first calculation of B-meson mixing beyond the standard model with physical quark masses. This eliminates a dominant error and will constrain new physics models. The project will provide the first calculation of form factors for B to D semileptonic decays at physical quark masses. This is used to  normalise a rare leptonic decay at LHCb and allows for calculation of an element of the CKM matrix, an important standard model parameter. This calculation will be able to reduce this portion of the error in the experimental rate below other sources, allowing for tighter constraints on new physics. The researcher is already experienced in using these methods and will carry out these calculations independently.\nThe second theme concerns a 3-sigma discrepancy between experiment and theory in g-2. Future experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC will reduce experimental errors to the point where theory errors from HC are dominant.

Due to the application of a novel nanoliter reactor technology, the evaluation of variant strains can be performed in ultra-high throughput mode (several millions per week) under substrate-limiting conditions, which is the most accurate reflection of the physiological challenges of producer cells in industrially relevant settings.

Many antiretroviral inhibitors have been developed to stop maturation but their efficacy has been undermined by the emergence of drug resistant mutations. Furthermore, the effect of such inhibitors on the internal spatiotemporal viral dynamics is unknown.  In order to quantitatively understand the determinants of maturation, inhibition and mutational resistance it is vital to construct a complete physics-based model of the maturation process.   This requires detailed understanding of how all the relevant viral molecular constituents interact with each other at the atomistic level, how this is affected by drug interactions and mutations in proteins and how this carries over to the large-scale cleavage and self-assembly process.
