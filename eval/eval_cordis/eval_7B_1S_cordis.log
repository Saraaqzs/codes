It targets persistent and severe allergy to fish and fruit. Besides persistence and severity, this choice is based on prevalence and the importance of these foods for a healthy diet. Classical allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) for treatment of food allergy using subcutaneous injections with food extracts has proven to be effective but too dangerous due to anaphylactic side-effects. FAST will therefore develop a safe alternative by replacing food extracts with hypo-allergenic recombinant major allergens, the active ingredients of SIT. Both severe fish and fruit allergy are caused by a single major allergen, parvalbumin for fish and lipid transfer protein for fruit. This makes development of a novel biotechnological product feasible. Two approaches will be evaluated for achieving hypoallergenicity, i.e. site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. The most promising hypo-allergenic versions of parvalbumin and lipid transfer protein will be produced under GMP conditions. After pre-clinical testing (toxicology testing and efficacy in mouse models), Phase I and II randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multi-center clinical trials will be performed. Two routes of administration will be evaluated, subcutaneous in case of fish and sublingual in case of fruit. The primary read-out will be the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge. To understand the underlying immune mechanisms of subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy, these trials will be accompanied by in depth serological and cellular immune analyses, allowing identification of novel biomarkers for monitoring treatment efficacy. FAST will improve the quality of life of food allergic patients by providing a safe and effective curative treatment that will end their dependence on avoidance and rescue medication.', '')]

results of pred sql: [('The key aspect of the Earth’s deep carbon cycle is how exogene carbon is recycled into the deeper earth via subduction of altered, carbonated, mafic oceanic crust. We aim to use ultrahigh-pressure experimental petrology to investigate the behaviour of subducted carbonate at pressures corresponding to the deep upper mantle, the mantle transition zone and the uppermost lower mantle. Earlier experimental studies showed that some residual crystalline carbonate in oceanic crust remains stable in subducting oceanic crust without decarbonation or melting, and may be transported to very deep levels in the mantle. It may form carbonate eclogite in the upper mantle and carbonate garnetite in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle. How far carbon can survive this journey to extreme depths depends on the relationship between the pressure-temperature path followed by deeply subducting carbonated oceanic crust and its melting relations and solidus temperatures. We aim to use multi-anvil experimentation at the University of Bristol to determine melting relations in the deep upper mantle, transition zone, and uppermost lower mantle (9-21 GPa) of carbonate eclogite. We will explore the influences of pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity and key bulk compositional variables such as Na2O/CO2 on very deep subduction of carbonate and on the volumes and compositions, and fates of carbonated partial melts. Fundamental research outcomes will include understanding of (1) the role of bulk composition in determining melting temperatures of deeply subducted, carbonate-bearing oceanic crust, and hence how deep carbonate melting can occur (2) how these carbonate melts interact with surrounding ambient peridotite mantle and what sort of geochemical sources and deeply derived magmas/fluids could be so generated (kimberlites, carbonatites, CH4-fluids), and (3) the formation of sublithospheric diamonds and their mineral inclusion suites.',)]

We will do this by developing novel biocathode systems with mixed cultures and integrating these with bioanodes in dedicated bioelectrochemical systems.
