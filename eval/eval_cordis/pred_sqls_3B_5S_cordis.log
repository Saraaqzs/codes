Social evolution theory increasingly understands the origin and elaboration of multicellular bodies and insect societies in a joint framework of inclusive fitness theory. This approach (A.F.G.

Genomic imprinting is the most fundamental mechanism that maintains selfish tendencies at the genome level, potentially affecting all forms of social life. While genomic imprinting is increasingly well understood in mammals, its frequency and operation in insect societies is unknown. The present proposal aims to resolve this problem by combining Chinese genome sequencing excellence (BGI Shenzhen) with a cutting-edge research program in evolutionary biology (the Copenhagen Centre for Social Evolution) while focusing on one of the best studied social insect models, the fungus-growing ants. The ambitious work proposed is feasible because it is supported by significant additional funding from the combined host institutions.

In the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics the fundamental particles obtain mass by the Higgs mechanism, which predicts the existence of the Higgs boson. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) marks the start of a programme of experimental studies to determine if the Higgs boson has the properties predicted by the SM. This proposal aims to measure the production of the Higgs boson in association with top quark pairs (ttH). This process gives direct access to the coupling between the Higgs boson and the heaviest known fundamental particle, the top quark, and hence will provide fundamental information on the origin of fermion masses.\n\nThe fellowship is a staged project, where the first part of the project uses the existing ATLAS data to make precise measurements of additional jet radiation in high transverse momentum top events. These measurements will provide the essential understanding of the main background to the ttH process and will also be of significant scientific interest in their own right. The second part of the project focusses on preparing the ATLAS data for the upcoming high energy LHC run, in particular commissioning the tracking detector that is undergoing a significant upgrade. This detector is essential to the successful detection of the ttH process. The final stage of the project will use state-of-the-art techniques to select the decay products of boosted top and Higgs particles. This will rely on the precise calibration of the techniques, which will be done in situ using the ATLAS data. The final outcome will be a search for ttH production, with the potential for a first direct measurement of the coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark.

Two particularly important areas are: new physics in B meson decays, and the muon anomalous magnetic moment (called g-2). The dominant theory uncertainty in both comes from hadronic corrections (HC) to SM processes which are very difficult to calculate precisely. Lattice QCD has uses high performance computing to calculate these numerically and has been very successful for many hadronic physics calculations.\n\nThis proposal has two parallel themes. The first involves using lattice QCD to calculate HC in B-meson decays. This project will carry out the first calculation of B-meson mixing beyond the standard model with physical quark masses. This eliminates a dominant error and will constrain new physics models. The project will provide the first calculation of form factors for B to D semileptonic decays at physical quark masses. This is used to  normalise a rare leptonic decay at LHCb and allows for calculation of an element of the CKM matrix, an important standard model parameter. This calculation will be able to reduce this portion of the error in the experimental rate below other sources, allowing for tighter constraints on new physics. The researcher is already experienced in using these methods and will carry out these calculations independently.\nThe second theme concerns a 3-sigma discrepancy between experiment and theory in g-2. Future experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC will reduce experimental errors to the point where theory errors from HC are dominant. The scientist in charge has performed pioneering work on the g-2 calculation and the researcher will work on improving this and one of the first calculations of the next to leading order component.

In this proposal, we suggest a completely novel approach of identifying genes and networks of central importance for allocating increasing fractions of a substrate flux to an industrial model product, vitamin B2 (riboflavin). Specifically, we propose to systematically vary, one by one and in combination, the translation levels of proteins belonging to the core metabolism of Escherichia coli as a model production organism and subsequently to evaluate the (millions of) resulting different strains for channeling steadily increasing substrate fluxes to product formation instead of growth. Due to the application of a novel nanoliter reactor technology, the evaluation of variant strains can be performed in ultra-high throughput mode (several millions per week) under substrate-limiting conditions, which is the most accurate reflection of the physiological challenges of producer cells in industrially relevant settings. This ability to screen large numbers of variant strains under substrate limiting conditions is fundamentally different from most other screening procedures and certainly unique at this level of throughput.', ''), (157889, 'VIRALMORPHMECH', 'Towards a complete spatiotemporal model of viral morphogenesis during HIV maturation', 'FP7-PEOPLE-2013-CIG', 'MC-CIG', '186942', '631926', '', '', '', '', '', 100000.0, 100000.0, 'FP7', 'Viral morphogenesis, the phenomenon by which viruses reorganize their internal macromolecular structure in space and time across their lifecycle, is a complex process that is not quantitatively understood. HIV maturation, in particular, involves detailed atomistic processes such as protein-ligand recognition and cleavage that triggers large-scale macromolecular spatiotemporal rearrangement such as capsid self-assembly and RNA-modulated nucleocapsid condensation leading to infectious virus particles (virions) in a sequence of morphological changes that need to be carefully timed. Many antiretroviral inhibitors have been developed to stop maturation but their efficacy has been undermined by the emergence of drug resistant mutations. Furthermore, the effect of such inhibitors on the internal spatiotemporal viral dynamics is unknown.  In order to quantitatively understand the determinants of maturation, inhibition and mutational resistance it is vital to construct a complete physics-based model of the maturation process.   This requires detailed understanding of how all the relevant viral molecular constituents interact with each other at the atomistic level, how this is affected by drug interactions and mutations in proteins and how this carries over to the large-scale cleavage and self-assembly process.  This project aims at deriving a multi-scale computer model of HIV maturation, integrating thermodynamic and kinetic binding data from massively parallel detailed molecular dynamics simulations of viral protein-protein and protein-drug interactions with particle-based reaction diffusion kinetics simulations describing the internal processing and remodeling in an entire virion explicitly in space and time.

results of pred sql: [('The key aspect of the Earth’s deep carbon cycle is how exogene carbon is recycled into the deeper earth via subduction of altered, carbonated, mafic oceanic crust. We aim to use ultrahigh-pressure experimental petrology to investigate the behaviour of subducted carbonate at pressures corresponding to the deep upper mantle, the mantle transition zone and the uppermost lower mantle. Earlier experimental studies showed that some residual crystalline carbonate in oceanic crust remains stable in subducting oceanic crust without decarbonation or melting, and may be transported to very deep levels in the mantle. It may form carbonate eclogite in the upper mantle and carbonate garnetite in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle. How far carbon can survive this journey to extreme depths depends on the relationship between the pressure-temperature path followed by deeply subducting carbonated oceanic crust and its melting relations and solidus temperatures. We aim to use multi-anvil experimentation at the University of Bristol to determine melting relations in the deep upper mantle, transition zone, and uppermost lower mantle (9-21 GPa) of carbonate eclogite. We will explore the influences of pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity and key bulk compositional variables such as Na2O/CO2 on very deep subduction of carbonate and on the volumes and compositions, and fates of carbonated partial melts. Fundamental research outcomes will include understanding of (1) the role of bulk composition in determining melting temperatures of deeply subducted, carbonate-bearing oceanic crust, and hence how deep carbonate melting can occur (2) how these carbonate melts interact with surrounding ambient peridotite mantle and what sort of geochemical sources and deeply derived magmas/fluids could be so generated (kimberlites, carbonatites, CH4-fluids), and (3) the formation of sublithospheric diamonds and their mineral inclusion suites.',)]
