It may form carbonate eclogite in the upper mantle and carbonate garnetite in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle.

We aim to use multi-anvil experimentation at the University of Bristol to determine melting relations in the deep upper mantle, transition zone, and uppermost lower mantle (9-21 GPa) of carbonate eclogite. We will explore the influences of pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity and key bulk compositional variables such as Na2O/CO2 on very deep subduction of carbonate and on the volumes and compositions, and fates of carbonated partial melts. Fundamental research outcomes will include understanding of (1) the role of bulk composition in determining melting temperatures of deeply subducted, carbonate-bearing oceanic crust, and hence how deep carbonate melting can occur (2) how these carbonate melts interact with surrounding ambient peridotite mantle and what sort of geochemical sources and deeply derived magmas/fluids could be so generated (kimberlites, carbonatites, CH4-fluids), and (3) the formation of sublithospheric diamonds and their mineral inclusion suites.')]

When did it start/end?  Was it patchy or smooth? How did galaxies reionize the Universe (if they did)? What are the properties of the earliest galaxies? To answer these questions, this proposal will use deep observations of the largest sample of the most powerful cosmic telescopes that will be observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) right after its launch.  Compared to all previous facilities, JWST’s capabilities are dazzling. Its instruments will provide data beyond those yet seen by any astronomer. However, with high power comes great responsibility.

Niche changes are expected to have important consequences: (i) they can invalidate niche-based species distribution models, as a widely used predictive conservation tool, due to the limited spatiotemporal context of the underlying species distribution data, and (ii) they can impact the performance of species (e.g. their conservation status and extinction risk) that become decoupled from their optimal environmental conditions. However, we still poorly understand how the magnitude of niche change varies among species, especially within their native distributions and over relatively short time spans under ongoing global change. I will study how and why the magnitude of niche change varies among bird species. More specifically, I will examine how species functional traits and rates of global change within the species' geographical ranges affect the magnitude of niche change, and how niche change may impact the conservation status of species.

Additionally, because standing levels of variation differ between species this makes assessing whether a population has “low” or “high” genetic diversity can be very difficult. In response, MUSEOMIC, will harness new ancient genetic and museomics techniques (sequencing of museum specimens), to measure changes in genetic diversity in three extremely vulnerable mammals (anoa, babirusa and Sulawesi warty pig) in the biodiversity hotspot of Wallacea. As an isolated tropical archipelago in Indonesia, Wallacea is the perfect natural laboratory for understanding how ancient and anthropogenic disturbances have impacted the genetic erosion of the three flagship mammals and is contributing to their decline. By tracking changes in genetic health through time and space, MUSEOMIC will gain insights into the extinction risk these unique taxa face and will directly benefit population management and long-term survival by identifying unique genetic diversity, designating conservation units, and making captive breeding recommendations.

To fully exploit the statistical power of Euclid, the intricacies of the data need to be understood, but we also need an accurate model of structure formation that can describe the interplay between galaxy formation, astrophysics, dark matter and cosmology.\n\nOCULIS tackles both aspects by providing the best measurements of the lensing signal and using the Euclid data in novel ways to relate observed galaxy properties directly to the matter distribution. To do so, we will (i) use in-flight data to correct for instrumental biases; (ii) measure the intrinsic alignments of galaxies that contaminate the lensing signal; (iii) exploit Euclid’s unique ability to determine the lensing signal on small scales to directly determine the stellar masses of galaxies for the first time, and to study the tidal stripping of dark matter halos; (iv) use the results to inform models that describe the small-scale astrophysics in hydrodynamic simulations, yielding robust predictions of the cosmological signals.

The following valorisation routes will be investigated: use of clay and fresh alperujo to manufacture ?green roofs?, recovery of compounds of interest from the liquid fraction of degreased alperujo by thermal hydrolysis, production of low-cost adsorbent materials from the solid fraction resulting from the hydrolysis process of degreased alperujo for the removal of contaminants from wastewater, and production of fuel gas by gasification of the solid fraction obtained from thermal hydrolysis of the degreased alperujo.

The experimental approach of the project represents a novel quasi-in situ electrochemical characterization (near ambient pressure x-ray photoemission spectroscopy), combined with atomic-scale access to the electronic structure (scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy) on the very same sample. The project will study thin films of transition metal oxides as model systems for exploring structure-function relationships, while presenting catalytic relevance for oxygen related reactions. The unique methodology of the project promises novel atomistic insight in the mechanism behind complex reactions with multiple intermediates, unveiling key parameters that can guide the design of active and selective electrocatalysts for cost-effective water electrolysis.', ''), (663448, 'TMAM', 'Towards a Mechanistic Account of Maintenance Goals', 'HORIZON-MSCA-2021-PF-01', 'HORIZON-AG-UN', '238739', '101058933', '2023-09-01', '2025-08-31', 2023, 2025, '', 0.0, 191760.0, 'HORIZON', 'People need to invest tremendous effort and motivational resources to ensure that all the valuable things they have will be maintained, on both an individual level (e.g., family, households, health) and a societal level (e.g., public infrastructures, the natural environment). Nevertheless, little is known about people’s motivation to routinely maintain, nurture, and care for what they have. Psychological theory on motivation has focused on approach (e.g., starting a new relationship) and avoidance goals (e.g., avoiding separation), and left maintenance goals understudied . Addressing this gap in the literature, the current project introduces and tests a first general model of goal-directed maintenance. Instead of increasing gains or avoiding negative outcomes, maintenance goals are used to stabilize positive current states. When maintaining one’s existing relationship, for instance, people are not only avoiding separation; they are engaged in a set of acts that stabilizes their relationship in a manner that keeps acute threats like separation at bay. In a similar manner, environmentalism is not only the aspiration to slow down global warming (an avoidance goal), but also, and perhaps more importantly, the aspiration that humanity will learn to maintain a stable relationship with the biological world. The proposed empirical research will combine lab studies using implicit behavioral measures with experience sampling methods (ESM). The results of this research will lay the foundation for the study of maintenance goals as distinct from approach and avoidance goals, shedding light on processes involved in the most pressing socio-political issues of our time.', '')]

We will do this by developing novel biocathode systems with mixed cultures and integrating these with bioanodes in dedicated bioelectrochemical systems.
